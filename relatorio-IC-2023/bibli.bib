    abstract = { Data-hungry applications are central to the largest online platforms. Using a novel approach that leverages data science to inform the economics, we demonstrate how data is a source of market power. We highlight the importance of data heterogeneity, whereby small feature differences translate into large value differences. We examine how concept drift, the existence of a nonstationary relationship between the predictive and target variables, implies that access to a continuous stream of data is competitively advantageous. We analyze how an information bottleneck and high sample complexity in existing applications lead to increasing returns to data. Finally, we show how user interaction control enables personalization that raises switching costs. The combined effect is a potent data barrier to entry that endows substantial market power to only the largest online platforms. Competition policy should focus on enabling entrants unfettered access to vast continuous data streams similar to those available to platform incumbents. }

abstract = {We review the results of six forecasting competitions based on the online data science platform Kaggle, which have been largely overlooked by the forecasting community. In contrast to the M competitions, the competitions reviewed in this study feature daily and weekly time series with exogenous variables, business hierarchy information, or both. Furthermore, the Kaggle data sets all exhibit higher entropy than the M3 and M4 competitions, and they are intermittent. In this review, we confirm the conclusion of the M4 competition that ensemble models using cross-learning tend to outperform local time series models and that gradient boosted decision trees and neural networks are strong forecast methods. Moreover, we present insights regarding the use of external information and validation strategies, and discuss the impacts of data characteristics on the choice of statistics or machine learning methods. Based on these insights, we construct nine ex-ante hypotheses for the outcome of the M5 competition to allow empirical validation of our findings.}

	abstract = {The twenty-ﬁrst century has ushered in the age of big data and data economy, in which data DNA, which carries important knowledge, insights and potential, has become an intrinsic constituent of all data-based organisms. An appropriate understanding of data DNA and its organisms relies on the new ﬁeld of data science and its keystone, analytics. Although it is widely debated whether big data is only hype and buzz, and data science is still in a very early phase, signiﬁcant challenges and opportunities are emerging or have been inspired by the research, innovation, business, profession, and education of data science. This paper provides a comprehensive survey and tutorial of the fundamental aspects of data science: the evolution from data analysis to data science, the data science concepts, a big picture of the era of data science, the major challenges and directions in data innovation, the nature of data analytics, new industrialization and service opportunities in the data economy, the profession and competency of data education, and the future of data science. This article is the ﬁrst in the ﬁeld to draw a comprehensive big picture, in addition to offering rich observations, lessons and thinking about data science and analytics.},
